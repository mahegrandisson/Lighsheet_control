Trying to image borosillicate in oil. Got some Brillouin signal. however, it is weak and movement within the sample support is limited. Need to find a better way to hold the glass (borosillicate). We could try to submerge the whole chamber with oil but this requires a lot of oil. Or we could remove de water chamber. 

PI Scan: Z= 10.8-11.8
PI Scan: Y= 1.8-2.5
PI Scan: X= 11.7-12.3

oil chamber but objective not submerged in it, still in air. 
Q: does being submerged in water provide extra/better brillouin signal ? idk but i'll have to check with Alexis when he comes back bc signal seemd a tad better with water immersion.


app changes : better params saving method for the scan. Parent Folder added.

cant seem to make a .exe file easily. Will look into it to maybe improve the code architecture

FEP,water and quartz cuvette imaging. The hardest is FEP for now, Brillouin signal is kinda flooded in light but still can see it. Paths update for the app.
